Keeping track of our team acca and looking at trends. Data covers the period between `r min(AccaData$Date)` and `r max(AccaData$Date)` and the gladiators playing are: `r unique(AccaData$Player)`. **That one time our acca actually came in was before data was collected.**

# Stats as a group

As a group, our overall win rate between `r min(AccaData$Date)` and `r max(AccaData$Date)` is **`r format(sum(AccaData$Win)/length(AccaData$Win)*100, digits = 2)`%**. As a group, we have backed `r length(unique(AccaData$Team))` different teams. Our most popular team to bet on is **`r names(which.max(table(AccaData$Team)))`**. Our most popular team to bet against is **`r names(which.max(table(AccaData$Against)))`**. The average odds for a bet are **`r format(mean(AccaData$Odds), digits = 3)`** ([converter to fractions if wanted](https://www.aceodds.com/bet-calculator/odds-converter.html)). Our biggest odds winning bet ever was by **`r AccaData[AccaData$Win == 1,] %>% filter(Odds == max(Odds)) %>% select(Player)`** when they bet on `r AccaData[AccaData$Win == 1,] %>% filter(Odds == max(Odds)) %>% select(Team)` to beat `r AccaData[AccaData$Win == 1,] %>% filter(Odds == max(Odds)) %>% select(Against)` at odds of `r AccaData[AccaData$Win == 1,] %>% filter(Odds == max(Odds)) %>% select(Odds)`. The softest of bets (unsurprisingly) came from **`r AccaData[AccaData$Odds == min(AccaData$Odds),"Player"]`** when they bet on `r AccaData[AccaData$Odds == min(AccaData$Odds),"Team"]` to beat `r AccaData[AccaData$Odds == min(AccaData$Odds),"Against"]` at odds of `r AccaData[AccaData$Odds == min(AccaData$Odds),"Odds"]` - the bet `r ifelse(AccaData[AccaData$Odds == min(AccaData$Odds),"Win"] == 1, "won", "lost")`: was it *really* worth it?

## Success (or lack thereof) tracker

```{r timetracker}
#AccaData %>% group_by(Date) %>% summarise(Wins = sum(Win), Odds = prod(Odds)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = Date)) + geom_bar(aes(y = Wins, fill = Date), stat = "identity") + geom_smooth(aes(y = Odds/70), stat = "identity") + theme_classic() + theme(legend.position = "none") + labs(title = "Weekly tracker", subtitle = "Bars for Wins (left axis), line for Total Odds (right axis)") + scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:11, sec.axis = sec_axis(name = "Odds", transform = ~.*70)) #get summary of each acca. this plot adds a second axis and plots a line for odds. I prefer the second plot for simplicity of figure and code

AccaData %>% group_by(Date) %>% summarise(Wins = sum(Win), Return = 11*prod(Odds)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = Date)) + geom_bar(aes(y = Wins, fill = Return), stat = "identity") + geom_text(aes(label=ceiling(Return), y = Wins),vjust=-0.5) + theme_classic() + labs(title = "Weekly tracker", subtitle = "Total estimated Return (£) from £11 stake shown above bar", caption = "bet365 boost odds on accas so the payout shown may be less than actual return on Doug's betslip") + ylim(c(0,11)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = 0:11) + theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(linetype = 2)) #get summary of each acca
```

## Home/Away and Odds tracker

Tracker of the ratio of home/away picks and a histogram showing at what odds our winning (and losing) bets are placed.

```{r homeaway, fig.show='hold', out.width='50%'}
ggplot(data = AccaData, aes(x = Date, y = Win, fill = HomeAway)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme_classic() + labs(title = "Home/Away tracker") + scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:11) #bar plot showing split of home or away picks for winning bets

#summary(lm(Win ~ Odds + HomeAway, data = AccaData)) #regression using odds and homeaway as predictors of win

ggplot(data = AccaData) + geom_histogram(aes(x = Odds, group = Win, fill = as.factor(Win)), binwidth = 0.1) + theme_classic() + labs(title = "Histogram of bets made at different odds", fill = "Win") + theme(legend.position = "inside", legend.position.inside = c(0.9,0.9)) + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2", direction = -1) #histogram showing success of bets at different odds. I think this plot could be a nice way of showing the sweet spot of odds

```

# Individual Stats

## Summary of each player (after `r length(unique(AccaData$Date))` picks)

```{r GroupTable}
#best way to present a lot of the data will be as a table
library(kableExtra)
PlayerSummary<- AccaData %>% group_by(Player) %>% summarise(PercentWin = format(sum(Win)/length(Win)*100, digits = 2),
                                            Mean = format(mean(Odds), digits = 3),
                                            Median = format(median(Odds), digits = 3),
                                            Min = format(min(Odds), digits = 3),
                                            Max = format(max(Odds), digits = 3),
                                            PercentHome = format(sum(HomeAway == "H")/length(HomeAway)*100, digits = 2),
                                            DifferentTeams = length(unique(Team)),
                                            FavouriteTeam = paste0(names(which.max(table(Team))), " (",table(Team)[which.max(table(Team))], ")"),
                                            HatedTeam = paste0(names(which.max(table(Against))), " (",table(Against)[which.max(table(Against))], ")"))

#PlayerSummary<- cbind(PlayerSummary, Consistency = as.numeric(PlayerSummary$Min)/as.numeric(PlayerSummary$Max)

PlayerSummary<- PlayerSummary[order(as.numeric(PlayerSummary$PercentWin), decreasing = TRUE),] #order by win%

PlayerSummary %>% kbl(caption = "For Favourite and Hated teams, number of times picked is shown in brackets. If there is tie, the team first alphabetically is shown.") %>% kable_classic(html_font = "Cambria") %>% kable_styling("striped") %>% column_spec(3, background = spec_color(as.numeric(PlayerSummary$Mean), option = "plasma")) %>% column_spec(4, background = spec_color(as.numeric(PlayerSummary$Median), option = "C")) %>% column_spec(5, background = spec_color(as.numeric(PlayerSummary$Min), option = "C")) %>% column_spec(6, background = spec_color(as.numeric(PlayerSummary$Max), option = "C")) %>% column_spec(3:6, bold = FALSE, color = "lightgreen")
```

The most timid player (ie shrunken balls) is `r PlayerSummary$Player[which.min(PlayerSummary$Median)]` whereas the bravest player is `r PlayerSummary$Player[which.max(PlayerSummary$Median)]`.

# Individual bet tracker

```{r playeroddsovertime}

```

# *What you could have won...*

What if you just placed a £1 stake on your selection every week instead? How many £££s would you be up (or down)?

```{r bettally}
Tally<- AccaData[AccaData$Win == 1,] %>% group_by(Player) %>% summarise(Total = sum(Odds)) %>% mutate(Winnings = Total - length(unique(AccaData$Date)))# %>% select(-2)

Tally<- Tally[order(as.numeric(Tally$Winnings), decreasing = TRUE),] #order by win%

#Tally$Winnings <- paste0("\u00A3", Tally$Winnings) #trying to add £ for nice readability but caused issues

Tally[-2] %>% kbl(caption = "What if you went it alone?", align = "lc", table.attr = "style='width:30%;'") %>% kable_classic(html_font = "Cambria") %>% kable_styling("striped") %>% column_spec(2, color = "white", background = ifelse(Tally$Winnings < 0, "red", "green"))
```

for(player in names(AccaModel)){
  #print(player)
print(ggroc(roc(AccaModel[[player]][["y"]], predict(AccaModel[[player]], type = "response"))) + geom_abline(intercept = 1, linetype = 2) + theme_classic() + labs(title = paste(player))) + labs(x = "False Positive Rate", y = "True Positive Rate") #ROC curve for model
}

#maybe these ROC curves will work better when more data has been collected?
